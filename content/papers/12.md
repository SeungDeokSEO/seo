Summary: "This paper builds a model of hypothesis testing with p-hacking and gives critical values that correct the inflated type 1 error rate caused by p-hacking. As a rule of thumb, such robust critical values are classical critical values with one fifth of the significance level."

##### Abstract

P-hacking is prevalent in reality but absent from classical hypothesis-testing theory. 
We therefore build a model of hypothesis testing that accounts for p-hacking.
From the model, we derive critical values such that, if they are used to determine significance, and if p-hacking adjusts to the new significance standards, spurious significant results do not occur more often than intended. Because of p-hacking, such robust critical values are larger than classical critical values. In the model calibrated to medical science, the robust critical value is the classical critical value for the same test statistic but with one fifth of the significance level.
