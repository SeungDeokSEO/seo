##### Abstract

Yes, with 40\% probability. To make this prediction, this note proposes a new Sahm-type recession indicator that combines vacancy and unemployment data. The indicator is the minimum of the Sahm indicator—the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the unemployment rate and its minimum over the past 12 months—and a similar indicator constructed with the vacancy rate—the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the vacancy rate and its maximum over the past 12 months. This new indicator is triggered earlier than the Sahm indicator: on average it detects recession 1.4 months after they have started, while the Sahm indicator detects them 2.6 months after their starts. The new indicator also has a better historical track record: it perfectly identifies all recessions since 1930, while the Sahm indicator breaks down before World War 2.  When our indicator reaches 0.3pp, a recession may have started. When the indicator reaches 0.8pp, a recession has started for sure. With July 2024 data, our indicator is at 0.5pp. So the probability that the US economy is now in recession is 40%. The recession may have started as early as March 2024.
